# Simple Games JS

<a href="https://github.com/ItaloPussi/simpleGamesJS/blob/master/readme.pt.md">VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs</a> ðŸ‘ˆ

In this repository you will find simple games created JS and eventually with a Canvas block. Periodically, intending to increase it with new subdirectories according to my creativity and as I practice the language and the use of the canvas.

## Installation

If you want to test some functionality, just clone the directory, access the chosen subdirectory and start the file ```index.html```

## Contributing

If you want to suggest an interesting game to be done in JS, feel free to open an issue.
